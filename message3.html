            <p>This is the story of standard 10th</p>
            </h1></b></u>
            <p>10th standard, a class after which every student would have been getting pain 
                of seperation from their classmates. A standard in which you are going to get 
                the first certificate of your life based on your academic qualification. A standard
                in whose result every relative is interested.The first unit test happened and 
                you topped the whole 10<sup>th</sup> standard and we came into the same class. 
                From then, it become my aim in life to have a healthy competiton with you and 
                to beat you everytime.Soon or later the exams happened and I topped the exam 
                sometimes and you topped the others. This competition turned us into good friends.
                We later become part of the whatsapp and resolved many doubts.

            <p>That group was a quite success as every member of group scoring above 90% and also 3 members
                getting into top 5 rankers of the school. That group is dead now but it created good memories
                between us.
