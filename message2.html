            <p>This is the story of standard 7th</p>

            <p>I saw you first when Mr. Sisir Kumar sir, our dear teacher of English subject 
                took us to watch the drama of the lesson "Gopal", I didnt remember the name of the 
                chapter as it is the thing of 2018. You were playing the role of king for rubies class and I was shocked
                by seeing the confidence of you while playing the role. Such confidence made me inspired 
                to play the same role for Jewels class.
            </p>
            <p>It was the normal interaction which made me inspire but the destiny could say that in future 
                we were going to be good competitors and later good friends. 
            </p>
