            <p>Story after the 10th boards</p>
            </h1></b></u>
            <p>10th was finally over and everyone was happy as papers went well. Farewell was organised
                but you didn't came cause of some reasons.After the exams, you ,me and Vinu were
                chatting and talking for hours and the date mentioned earlier, you offered us the 
                posititon of the admin in the whatsapp group which we both didn't know would become so chaotic 
                resulting the calls from former teachers. The grouped was named "DARE". A simple truth and
                dare game turned into chaotic dares, like blaming teachers for not teaching, proposing the crushes
                , propsing the random persons and pranks calls. These dares turned us into even better friends 

            </p>
            <p>The group is a bit quite now and some dares still are not completed but it made very mind 
                refreshing memories. The ones I would tell to my childrensðŸ˜‚.
